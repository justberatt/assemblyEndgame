# Project planning:
  
  Questions to ask yourself before writing any code:
  
  1. What are the main containers of elements I need
    in this app?
   - Text container (heading and paragraph)
   - Answer modal
   - Languages container
   - The word to be answered (The empty spaces)
   - Letters
   - New Game Button
  
  2. What values will need to be saved in state vs.
    what values can be derived from the state?
    (What values do we need to know about?)
   - If the game is over or not
   - If the user has won or lost
   - How many wrong guesses the user has had
   - What the randomly selected word by the game is
   - Which letters the user has already guessed
  
  3. How will the user interact with the app? What
    events do I need to handle?
   - Clicking the keys (letters (the keyboard))
   - New Game Button
