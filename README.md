# Project planning:
  
  Questions to ask yourself before writing any code:
  
  - What are the main containers of elements I need
    in this app?
   - Text container (heading and paragraph)
   - Answer modal
   - Languages container
   - Letters
   - New Game Button
  
  - What values will need to be saved in state vs.
    what values can be derived from the state?
   - Not sure
  
  - How will the user interact with the app? What
    events do I need to handle?
   - Clicking the letters
   - New Game Button
